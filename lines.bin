–From fairest creatures we desire increase,
That thereby beautyâ€™s rose might never die,
But as the riper should by time decrease,
His tender heir mught bear his memeory:
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
Feedâ€™st thy lightâ€™st flame with self-substantial fuel,
Making a famine where abundance lies,
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
                       By William Shakespeare
